# odin-members-only

## A message board website with a few rules:
1. Everybody logged in can post messages
2. Non-members can only see titles and contents
3. Only members can see the author and date
4. Admins can additionally delete messages

### Made with the T3 Stack:
- Next.js as the Meta-Framework
- tRPC as the backend connection method
- NextAuth.js for authentication
- Prisma as the ORM of choice
- TailwindCSS as the css framework

### Additional technologies used:
- daisyUI as the component library
- clsx and tailwind-merge for conditional tailwind classes
- Radix Icons for icons
- React Hook Form for handling forms
- Zod for object validation
- Day.js for date formatting
- bcryptjs for password hashing
- Jotai to avoid prop drilling on one page
- TypeScript (obviously for type-safety)

Member passcode: `etheryen`
Admin passcode: `secretpasscode` (use it wisely)

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.
